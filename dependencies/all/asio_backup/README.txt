Copy the `boost', `doc' and `libs' directories into an existing boost
distribution.

Before using Boost.Asio, the Boost.System library needs to be built. This can
be done by running b2 in the libs/system directory. Consult the Boost Getting
Started page (http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html) for more
information on how to build the Boost libraries.
